We use [swaggerhub](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/supertokens/FDI) to host the API spec.

It is written in a `.yaml` (starting from >= v1.8.0). To edit it:
- 1) Go to [the swagger editor](https://editor.swagger.io/)
- 2) Copy / paste the contents of the `.yaml` file into the editor, and then you should see the API docs on the right of the screen.
- 3) Make changes to the online editor and then copy / paste the content back into the `.yaml` file
- 4) Issue a PR

When releasing a new FDI version, add the spec to swaggerhub from this repo.
